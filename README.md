# louisville-website
Poject website name:  Louisville-website.  Titled "The Ville". 

This is a travel informational site for visitors coming to Louisville Kentucky. It gives you attractions to see as well as resturants  and other venues to go.  This site talks about some of Louisville's sites such as the Zoo and wine tasting places to try.   There are links under the pictures that give more information on dinning etc.  
The horizonal navigation menu gives you taps to click on for a packet to be emailed to you or Covid news and also features a map of downtown louisville. 
I provide a selection bar with tabs that allow you to navagate to other sites and also allows you to request a "packet" be emailed to you.
