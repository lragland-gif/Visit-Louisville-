    ,<P>Louisville, KYâ€” After two and a half months of capacity restrictions for indoor businesses sitting firmly at
      50%, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Monday those limits would be increased to 60%.

      Beginning Friday, businesses like bars, restaurants, gyms, salons and movie theaters will be allowed to operate at
      60% capacity, because Kentucky is on its seventh straight week of declining COVID-19 cases.

      Beshear stressed this change would only apply to businesses that have the space to do so.

      "There are still mask mandates in place, and the increase is only allowed if you can achieve it, while still
      maintaining that six feet of social distance," he said.

      The allowance is an "initial step" to watch and see, Beshear said, to ensure the Commonwealth doesn't see a
      corresponding increase in COVID-19 cases.
